This project gives two programs to draw turtle figures of morphic sequences.

The simplest one is in Python, and is called turtlepython.txt. This may be run directly by Python.
It gives one particular example of a turtle figure of a morphic sequence. In order to obtaine other turtle
figures, the angles, morphic sequence, number of steps and unit length may be modified in the program.
A drawback is that it is quite slow, in particular when the number of steps is large.

The other program is obtained by unzipping turtle.zip. This program is written in Lazarus, the program 
executable on Windows is available as turtle.exe. After starting this program, instructions on how to use it 
are obtained by clicking on HELP. A number of interesting examples is already available, and the program 
facilitates creating and saving new examples. It serves for running up to 400,000 steps.

The program is fully open source: all sources of the program are available in the zip file.
