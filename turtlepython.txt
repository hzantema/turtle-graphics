# This Python program draws the turtle figure of f^infty(0) for f defined by
# f(0 = 010, f(1) = 11, and the angles h0 = 168 degrees nad h1 = -45 degrees.
# In fact it only draws the first 1400 steps, but it can be argued that doing more steps only 
# redraws segments that were drawn before.

# The program is easily adjusted to draw turtle figures of other morphic sequences over 0 and 1, by only 
# modifying the number of steps, the angles h0 and h1, the definitions of f(0) and f(1), and the step size.
